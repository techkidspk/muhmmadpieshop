                    <p style="color:blueviolet" >
                        For many years, <b>Muhammad</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at his home.In 2013, he opened his first store 
                        in Islamabad (Pakistan) in a cossy little near The Medical Store.People from all over the world fell in love with the <i>soft cakes,
                        cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...</i>The store became a succes in no time.<br>.In 2015, no less than 100 pies sold every day and 
                        Muhammad's Pie Shop moved into a larger building. After many requests, it became clear that our next step was to order
                        pies from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere else in the world. You are now looking at the result of this:
                        our very own webstore, making it possible to order Muhammad's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Muhammad is famous for using only the best ingredients.This way we can make sure that our pies are absolutely
                        the best.
